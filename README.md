A collaborative, version-controlled mindmap. built for the [FOSS 2020 Hackathon](https://fossunited.org/hackathon) organized by FOSS United.

## Demo
https://hivemind.vercel.app/

## Vision
Hivemind was envisioned to have the following features:

1. Version control - rewind your mindmap to any previous state.
2. Sharing - share your mindmap with read/write/admin access to authenticated users, or make it publicly visible (read-only) to everyone.
3. Collaborative, realtime editing - all users with write access to a mindmap should be able to simultaneously edit it, and view each other's changes in real time.
